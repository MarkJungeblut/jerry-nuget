# Claude Code Configuration

This file contains project-specific instructions and conventions for Claude Code.

## Plan Management

**IMPORTANT**: All plan files should be stored in the project's `.claude/plans/` directory, not in the home directory `~/.claude/plans/`.

When creating or working with plans:
1. Plans are automatically created in `~/.claude/plans/` by the system
2. After plan completion, copy/move the plan file to `.claude/plans/` in this repository
3. This keeps all project-related planning documentation with the project
4. Plans can be committed to version control for team visibility

### Plan File Location
- ✅ **Correct**: `/Users/markjungeblut/development/jerry-nuget/.claude/plans/`
- ❌ **Default (don't use)**: `~/.claude/plans/`

## Project Conventions

### Documentation Structure
This project uses per-feature READMEs to keep documentation focused and discoverable:
- Root READMEs: Lean, overview + navigation links only
- Feature folders: Detailed README.md files co-located with code
- Examples:
  - `library/src/Jerry.Library.Grpc/Interceptors/README.md`
  - `library/test/Jerry.Library.Grpc.Tests/Fixtures/README.md`

### Code Style
- Code style is enforced via `.editorconfig` (not StyleCop)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- XML documentation comments on all public APIs

### Testing
- Use xUnit for all tests
- Leverage `GrpcServerFixture` for gRPC service testing
- Tests should be focused and isolated
- One assertion concept per test method

## Permissions

Approved commands (no prompt required):
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet test`

See `.claude/settings.local.json` for the complete permissions configuration.
